# Bacteria Biodiversity

## Background

### Purpose

In order to create a "Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard" web application that displays information about each volunteer's samples based on their ID number, JavaScript, Plotly and D3.js are used to call and visualize the data for each individual volunteer. The current web app was updated to include a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 sample values, a bubble chart of bacteria cultures per sample, a gauge displaying belly button washing frequency and overall customizations in the web app appearance.
